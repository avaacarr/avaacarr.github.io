# My portfolio

My goal this year is to learn JavaScript. I am more interested in learning that program first, however my goal for the semester is to learn about both JavaScript and Python. I completed the freecodecamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification tutorial on 10/5/2020 and below is a screenshot of it completed.
